A really simple escrow contract with a lean JS + web3.js GUI.
The contract contains a bunch of events the client listens to, so you get feedback if you wait a little bit.

You can deploy a new sales contract between two parties with the topmost fields. Set the buyer's address, and the seller's, and you become the arbitrator.

Paste in the address of an existing sales contract and click `Open Contract` to observer it's status, and interact with it.

This Dapp was created for the TIEP1000 course in Jyväskylä University.
